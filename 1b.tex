\subsection*{b)}
Now we want to generate 3D satellite positions following the satellite profile \( n(x) \). Note that \( n(x) \) is a number density, while \( N(x)dx \) is the number of galaxies in the infinitesimal range \([x, x + dx)\). Here we are choosing \( h \) as a small parameter to obtain the number of galaxies within a specific range.

With:
\begin{align}
    p(x) dx &= N(x) \frac{dx}{\langle N_{\text{sat}} \rangle}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{align}
    N(x) &= \int_x^{x+dx} \iint n(x') \sin \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, x'^2 \, dx' = 4 \pi \int_x^{x+dx} n(x') x'^2 \, dx'
\end{align}

We want to sample the probability distribution of the relative radii \( x \in [0,5) \). Therefore, we generate 10,000 points and make a log-log plot showing \( N(x) \).
\begin{align}
    p(x) &= \frac{N(x)}{\langle N_{\text{sat}} \rangle}  \\
    &= \frac{4 \pi}{\langle N_{\text{sat}} \rangle} \int_x^{x+dx} n(x') x'^2 \, dx' \\
    &= 4 \pi A \frac{1}{b}^{a-3} \int_x^{x+dx} x'^{a-1} \exp\left(-\frac{x'}{b}^c\right) \, dx'
\end{align}

We also generate a histogram of our 10,000 (slice-sampled) points. We use 20 logarithmically-spaced bins between \( x = 10^{-4} \) and \(x_{\text{max}} = 5 \). We divide each bin by its width.

To obtain random numbers, we have chosen the xor method, which we scale down to be in the range \( [0,1] \). Therefore, we obtain a uniform random number generator. We also had to normalize the bars histogramm, fist by the width and second by the offset.

    \caption{In this figure, we plot the number of galaxies over the virial radius \( x \). The histogram was created by slice sampling with the \( p(x) \) distribution, which is related to the \( N(x) \) distribution as explained.}
